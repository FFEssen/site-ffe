<hr>
Freifunk is:

...a non commercial open initiative to support free and open (operated by the general public) radio networks (WLAN) in the German region.
It is is part of the international movement for free wireless radio networks and free networks in general.

<hr>
We use [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/)/[LEDE](https://www.lede-project.org/) based firmware to build mesh-networks using [batman-adv](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batman-adv/wiki) and optionally encrypted VPN tunnels using [fastd](https://projects.universe-factory.net/projects/fastd/wiki). 
Our firmware is basically a fork of [freifunk-gluon](https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon) with patches applied for more practical use.<hr>

This is the site repo where we store the firmware configuration files and patches for the Freifunk community in Essen (Germany).<br />
You can find our gluon buildscripts [here](https://github.com/FFEssen/firmware).
Additional packages used can be found [here](https://github.com/FFEssen/packages).
